# Arduino Developed Smart Cane - No Pain No Cane
No Pain No Cane's Arduino utlized smart cane is a university developed project aimed at assisting people with a visual impairment in everyday life. The programming language utilized was Arduino's own computing platform, and was implemented first onto an Arduino Uno then an Arduino Nano (both assembled prior to the team purchasing such boards).

## Contents of the Repository
This repository contains the code for the smart canes' ultrasonic detection, as well as the CAD files for the smart cane's handle as were created in the 3DExperience software. This repository also contains the blank datasheets and the completed datasheets, as well as sketches for the project. 

Please note that the actual Arduino platform and IDE were downloaded and installed from the [main Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).

## Building & Testing the Design
The comprehensive conception, development and finalization of the design can be found in the *Project Report* file contained within this repository, which will detail exactly how the team went about designing and concluding the project at hand. 

Please note that videos of the circuit working were too large for the repository and have been separately uploaded to a Google Drive [folder]().

Results of the project are also contained within the report.
